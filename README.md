# JavaScript Compiler

This is the project that was carried out for the first part of the subject "Programming languages". It uses the PLY library which helped us out with the lexical and syntactic part of the JavaScript programming language.

In order to use our program you should run the following commands:
```
cd analizador
py sintactico
```

You can write any example in the JavaScript language!
Here are some example codes:

```
JavaScript > var hola = 5 + 20
None
JavaScript > if(hola > 5){ hola = 10}
None
JavaScript > let fecha = new Date()
None
JavaScript > let lista = [ 1, 2, 3] 
None
JavaScript > lista.pop()
None
```
